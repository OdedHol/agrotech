# Deep Water Culture (DWC)
We aimed to understand how plants that grow in hydroponic systems absorb nutrients through water. To achieve this, we developed a hydroponic system that measures the nutrient levels in the water and automatically adjusts the pH and fertilizer accordingly.

Using five EPSs, we were able to continuously monitor essential factors such as TDS, pH, water temperature, and leaf temperature.

Additionally, our system ensures a consistent water supply and regulates pH and fertilizer application based on the plants' requirements and predetermined intervals

In order to simulate the hydroponic system we used a large plastic box with three holes on the top. This box is filled with water gradually with a hose connected to a floater which indicates the water level. On the top of the box three infant lettuce plants were placed in the water. PH and EC sensors are placed as well in the hydroponic system. In addition, sensors for the surrounding air temperature and for the temperature of the leaves were placed on top of the box. 



## Why do we need our hydroponic system?

The popular hydroponic system available in the market is expensive and not suitable for every budget. The hydroponic system we offer contains inexpensive and quality components that perform the same task.
