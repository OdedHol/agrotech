# Deep Water Culture (DWC)
We aimed to understand how plants that grow in hydroponic systems absorb nutrients through water. To achieve this, we developed a hydroponic system that measures the nutrient levels in the water and automatically adjusts the pH and fertilizer accordingly.

Using five EPSs, we were able to continuously monitor essential factors such as EC, pH, water temperature, and leaf temperature.

Additionally, our system ensures a consistent water supply and regulates pH and fertilizer application based on the plants' requirements and predetermined intervals
