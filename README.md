# Deep Water Culture (DWC)
We wanted to understaned how plants that grow in hydrophnic system absorb their nutrients through the water.
To do so, we built a hydrophonic system, that massure the nutrients of the water and provide ph or fertelizer as needed automaticlly./n
By using 5 (?) EPS's we managed to maintain a on going measurment of EC, pH, water temp, leaf temp etc.\n
While also provide constant water, pH and fertelizer based on need and time we chose randomly.
